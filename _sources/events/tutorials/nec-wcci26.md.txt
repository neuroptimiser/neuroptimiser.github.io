## Abstract

Neuromorphic computing brings spiking dynamics and event-driven efficiency into the realm of optimisation. Evolutionary algorithms, long valued for their versatility, can now be re-imagined on this substrate. We first present the theoretical principles behind neuromorphic-based metaheuristics, highlighting their motivations, classification, and trade-off. We then detail the [NeurOptimiser](http://neuroptimiser.github.io) framework, a practical architecture where Neuromorphic Heuristic Units implement mutation and variation through spikes. Finally, we discuss some practical implementations with the open-source Neuroptimiser package, showing participants how to design, run, and interpret neuromorphic optimisation experiments. This tutorial aims to show how spiking computation can shape a new generation of evolutionary search, and open paths to applications in robotics, IoT, and embedded intelligence.

(objectives)=
## Learning Objectives

The main objective of this session is to equip participants with both conceptual and practical tools to understand and apply neuromorphic-based evolutionary computation algorithms. 

In particular, by the end of the tutorial, participants will:
1.	Understand the theoretical foundations of neuromorphic evolutionary optimisation.
2.	Recognise the state-of-the-art architectures and their trade-off.
3.	Learn from the authors the practical details and rationale for using and modifying the Neuroptimiser package to run experiments.
4.	Identify research opportunities for scaling, hybridisation, and applications in WCCI’s fields.
