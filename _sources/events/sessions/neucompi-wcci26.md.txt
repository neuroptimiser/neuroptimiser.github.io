(aim-and-scope)=
## Aim and Scope

Between signals and noise, _animata et taxidermata_, excitations and inhibitions, two communities are believed to have evolved in isolation. On the one hand, Computational Intelligence (CI) has established itself as a leading paradigm for solving complex optimisation and learning tasks, primarily through the design of metaheuristics, evolutionary algorithms, and adaptive systems. On the other hand, Neuromorphic Computing (NC) has advanced architectures and models inspired by neural computation, emphasising asynchronous, event-driven, and energy-efficient processing. Together, these perspectives define a research space in which optimisation and learning emerge from the dynamics of spiking neurons, synapses, and networks, rather than being externally orchestrated.

Nowadays, when the demand for scalability and energy efficiency is pushing the limits of classical hardware and algorithms, these two fields find themselves converging. CI provides a mature corpus of algorithmic design strategies, from population-based heuristics to reinforcement-driven adaptation, that can be reformulated in spike-based, event-driven substrates. NC, however, is not only a matter of hardware design but also a scientific effort to understand and replicate the dynamics of real brains. It integrates insights from neuroscience, physics, and circuit design to capture how neurons and synapses process information, adapt through plasticity, and operate under noise and variability.

This special session is the first to explicitly explore the synergy between Computational Intelligence and Neuromorphic Computing in the context of optimisation and learning. Its relevance lies in positioning neuromorphic optimisation as a distinct strand within computational intelligence, complementing rather than competing with mainstream approaches. Our main objective is to create a dedicated forum where contributions rethink optimisation and learning as hardware-aware processes that can be embedded directly in neuromorphic substrates. This session also aims to consolidate a community and define a roadmap for this emerging field.

(session-format)=
## Session Format

The session will consist of **five presentations of 15 minutes each**, covering algorithms, adaptation, hardware, and applications, followed by **45 minutes of structured open debate**. The discussion will revolve around spike-triggering questions, aiming to encourage exchange, define open problems, and outline a roadmap for neuromorphic optimisation and learning.
